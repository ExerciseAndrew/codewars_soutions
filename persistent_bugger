###Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.


def persistence(n):
    xopr = 0
    patsy = 1
    
    while (n > 9):
        if patsy == 1:
            patsy = (n % 10)
        n -= (n % 10)
        n /= 10
        patsy *= (n % 10)
        if (n <= 9):
            n = patsy
            patsy = 1
            xopr += 1
    return xopr
