# codewars_soutions
Just trying to git gud.

Codewars puzzles are fairly addictive. While the 'katas' themselves each feel like an accomplishment, 
the greatest of my gains is a new and budding ability to break problems into smaller, easier to solve
problems. I do get stuck and have to use other resources quite a bit, but I make it a little further 
into each puzzle before needing to tug a lifeline.
I'm really liking the string processing capabilities of Python. I am not looking forward to attempting
the codewars puzzles in C++.
